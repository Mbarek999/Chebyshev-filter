# Chebyshev-filter
We began by studying the filter, carrying out the synthesis of both an analog Chebyshev filter and a digital Chebyshev filter. This synthesis involves specific steps tailored to each domain. We then analyzed the design of these filters, which is based on mathematical equations used to achieve the desired response characteristics, thus offering flexibility to adapt to the specific needs of electronic systems. This work will be carried out using LabVIEW and Simulink, which are recognized as powerful tools for the design, testing, and validation of filters.
